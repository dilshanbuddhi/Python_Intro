# Variable Rules 🌈
    # 1️⃣ A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    # 2️⃣ A variable name cannot start with a number
    # 3️⃣ A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    # 4️⃣ Variable names are case-sensitive
    # 5️⃣ Avoid using Python keywords as variable names

    #❌ if = 10
    #❌ else = 20

# ❌ @name = " dila "
# ❌ @age = 20
# @age = 20
# 🤦️IndentationError: unexpected indent

# 🟢 name = " dila "
# 🟢 _age = 20

# Best Practices 🌈
    # 1️⃣ python variable names are lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary

    # 🟢 first_name = "buddhi"
    # 🟢 last_name = "dilshan"

    # ❌ FirstName = "buddhi"  camelCase  😒 not allowed 😒

    # Variable name must be descriptive

    # 🟢 student_name = "buddhi"
    # ❌ st = "buddhi"

# Constants 🌈
    # 1️⃣ Constants are named in ALL_CAPS with words separated by underscores as necessary
    # 2️⃣ Constants should be descriptive
    # 3️⃣ Constants should be immutable

    # 🟢 PI = 3.14
    # ❌ pi = 3.14
